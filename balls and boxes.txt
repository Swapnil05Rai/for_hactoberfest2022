Problem
You have NN balls and KK boxes. You want to divide the NN balls into KK boxes such that:

Each box contains ≥1 balls.
No two boxes contain the same number of balls.
Determine if it is possible to do so.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK — the number of balls and the number of boxes respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to divide the NN balls into KK boxes such that the conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
